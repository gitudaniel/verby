Direct attacks against fellow readers and writers are strictly forbidden (ad hominem attacks) and steps will be taken. Criticism of an idea or writing or writing style is allowed and highly encouraged. We are not responsible for the information in the articles themselves only the quality of writing employed in the creation of articles.

By choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation.

SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT. Payments not made within ten (10) days of invoicing will be deemed in arrears. For accounts in arrears, if any amount is more than ten (10) days overdue, without the requirement of providing notice of such arrears, Verby may suspend service to such account and bring legal action to collect the full amount due, including any attorneys’ fees and costs. If a Subscriber is past due on their balance, Verby may send up to three (3) email notifications within a fifteen (15) day period before suspending the Subscriber's account. Access to the platform will be restricted during this period. Verby reserves the right to delete the Subscriber's suspended machines after the final termination notice.

You acknowledge that we have no duty to take any action regarding: i. which Subscribers gain access to the Services; ii. what Content you access via the Services; or iii. how you may interpret or use the Content.

SUBSCRIBER HEREBY WAIVES ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AGAINST VERBY ARISING OUT OF SUBSCRIBER'S PURCHASE OR USE OF THE SERVICES, OR ANY CONDUCT OF VERBY’S DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIVES. YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RIGHT AND REMEDY IN CASE OF DISSATISFACTION WITH THE SERVICES OR ANY OTHER GRIEVANCE SHALL BE YOUR TERMINATION AND DISCONTINUATION OF ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE SERVICES. IN ADDITION, YOU AGREE THAT VERBY IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DATA COMPILED BY OUR SERVICES AND THAT VERBY WILL NOT BE LIABLE, IN ANY MANNER, AS A RESULT OF YOUR EXPOSURE TO ANY DEFAMATORY, LIBELOUS, THREATENING, UNLAWFULLY HARASSING, OBSCENE OR OTHERWISE UNLAWFUL CONTENT OR DATA.

		Subscriber shall keep confidential any confidential information to which it is given access, and shall cooperate with Verby's efforts to maintain the confidentiality thereof. Subscriber shall not publish to third parties or distribute information or documentation that Verby provides for purposes of operating and maintaining its systems, including material contained in estimates, invoices, work orders, or other such materials.

		Mindful of the high cost of litigation, you and Verby agree to the following dispute resolution procedure: in the event of any controversy, claim, action or dispute arising out of or related to: (i) the Website; (ii) this Agreement; (iii) the Services; (iv) the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of this Agreement; or (v) any other dispute between you and Verby (“Dispute”), the party asserting the Dispute shall first try in good faith to settle such Dispute by providing written notice to the other party (by first class or registered mail) describing the facts and circumstances (including any relevant documentation) of the Dispute and allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond to or settle the Dispute. Notice shall be sent if to you at: your last-used billing address or the billing and/or shipping address in your Account information. Both you and Verby agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent that must be satisfied prior to initiating any arbitration or filing any claim against the other party. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Verby in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Verby agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND DIGITALOCEAN ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. Despite the provisions of Section 15.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim 
		%h4 Writer terms and conditions
		%p  By agreeing to this you give us the authority to redistribute your content as we may see fit. We will still include you the writer’s name in any distributions. We will take great care to ensure the security of the platform but we will not be held responsible if you give your password away. You agree to our 70% compensation plan but this amount will be less processing charges incurred in transferring you any amounts gained. We will keep the process clear and transparent and you agree that we retain the right to alter the terms and conditions as we see fit. Direct attacks against fellow writers and readers are strictly forbidden (ad hominem attacks) and steps will be taken. Criticism of an idea or writing or writing style is allowed and highly encouraged. We are not responsible for the information in the articles themselves only the quality of writing employed in the creation of articles. You’re also responsible for the acts of others utilizing your access to our services, as we have no way of distinguishing your actions from the actions of your sub-users. Be careful who you give your information to – it’s to protect both us and you. Writers are restricted from registering multiple Accounts with the same billing details without first notifying Verby of that intent. Otherwise, Verby shall have the right to automatically flag such Accounts as fraudulent or abusive, and Digital Ocean may, without notification to the owner of such Account, suspend the service of such Account or any other Account used by such Subscriber. The use of referral codes by multiple Accounts having the same billing profile is not allowed. Verby also reserves the right to terminate a Subscriber's Account if it is targeted by malicious activity from other parties. Writers should only submit proprietary content to the platform. We are not responsible for any consequences that may befall the users due to submission of plagiarized material. That responsibility falls solely on the writer. Subscribers may not use the Services in violation of the copyrights, trademarks, patents or trade secrets of third parties, nor shall they utilize the Services to publish such materials in a manner that would expose them to public view in violation of the law. All other applicable international trademark, copyright, patent or other intellectual property laws will apply to issues presented by allegations of copyright violations by third parties. Verby will, in appropriate circumstances, terminate the accounts of repeat violators. If a third party believes that a Subscriber of Verby is violating its intellectual property rights, it should notify. A notification should include information reasonably sufficient to permit Verby to locate the allegedly infringing material, such as the original article proposed to have been plagiarized.
