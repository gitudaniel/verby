Then I always thought of it as a euphemism for saying I&rsquo;m trying to save money by skipping meals or more bluntly I&rsquo;m broke and if I eat I am royally screwed. Maybe that&rsquo;s just because to me it was unimaginable to skip lunch while reading coursework unless there was a cat or an exam in a few hours. But even then I still rationalized my way out of it by saying it is improper to sit for an exam or cat on an empty stomach. I mean you could be in the middle of a test and get distracted by how hungry you are. This will often lead to lack of straight thinking and inevitable failure. Look at that doesn&rsquo;t it make sense.</p><p><br />Alternatively maybe I was just a poor student. I mean every time the clock hits 1 pm I&rsquo;d automatically know. Its like there was an internal clock in my body telling me to go seek out sustenance. If I was reading my coursework I&rsquo;d leave without fail and I rarely went back to the library I mean with the scorching sun and all. But if I was doing anything other than coursework I would not leave unless it was really necessary that I do, what with the scorching sun and all.&nbsp;</p><p><br />Of course there were the times when I told myself that I&rsquo;d read from my room just to avoid the 15 minute trek to the library and map out how saving those 15 minutes plus an additional 10 for settling down would increase overall productivity. I say 10 minutes because I have to do my complex math to make sure I don&rsquo;t get the sun in my face later in the day. Once that is done I&rsquo;ll sit down take out my books and do a visual survey of the vicinity to see how busy people are or look to be. But I digress. So in my mind I&rsquo;d know I was going to be so productive&hellip;cue movie montage (i.e. the music that plays when guys are working hard) and know that I&rsquo;d achieve my goals for the day. That is until I hear that ubiquitous knock on my door. It is at that moment I know that is the end of my productive streak.</p><p><br />End of productivity is not instantaneous it&rsquo;s more gradual. My friend comes in sees me reading and exclaims, &ldquo;Thank God you&rsquo;re reading. I can finally get something done today.&rdquo; They come in sit down take a book. It works for some time till the statement did you hear about&hellip; is uttered then the story begins. Once that starts it&rsquo;s like my circle of friends have a homing beacon to tell them where the story&rsquo;s at because they turn up one at a time giving their unique flavor to the story. And before you know it four years are over and you&rsquo;re now being expected to look for a job. Your most notable skill being expert narrator.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>','gitudaniel@gmail.com','',NULL,NULL,'2016-04-21 22:18:18','2016-05-16 16:32:09',2,NULL,NULL),(5,'Nightly rides','Untitled is I','<p>Lately due to the sheer volume of work that needs to get done I normally get myself leaving for home at around 9pm at best. Also because of cost constraints I skip lunch, which generally sounds like a good idea right after breakfast when you&rsquo;re full. Just wait till 12 when the pangs of hunger gather their mighty armies to strike you where you stand or sit (basically whatever you&rsquo;re doing at the time). At that point in time you realize it is generally a bad idea to think of skipping lunch. If extra coin is present you make plans to have the cheapest lunch possible. Problem with this is the armies think you&rsquo;re just taunting them and they strike back with even more fervor than before and tell you not to insult them with crumbs. I mean it&rsquo;s a proper meal a full meal even, but no it&rsquo;s just not enough. It&rsquo;s never enough. Sometimes I think it would be easier to brave through the hunger but rational thought is thrown out of the window in the thick of things. On the days when extra coin falls under the same category as fairies and unicorns I shut my eyes in prayer asking for strength to withstand temptation and grip that bottle of water tightly and imagine the hunger away with intermittent sips of water when temptation becomes too real.</p><p><br />So it&rsquo;s 9 pm and it&rsquo;s freezing. Most of the people out are thinking of going home, unless it&rsquo;s a Friday where most people are thinking of going anywhere but home. I board a matatu and everyone there is tired, hungry and thinking of sleep (I like to think they are so that my problems are not unique to me). Walk in sit down and start the countdown to my next meal. Once more I have to iterate that it is cold so everyone generally avoids opening the windows in the car. There are 33 souls in the vehicle breathing in and out, generating warmth and no open windows so there is this soothing ball of warmth that sort of cuddles you on your trip home and makes you only desire the warmth of your bed as you dread waking up the following day.</p><p><br />The warmth is amazing, that is until that inconsiderate renegade sullies it by opening the fries they bought before boarding. I like to think of Samuel L. Jackson as I say this in my head &ldquo;YOU DUMB MOTHERFUCKER&rdquo;. You see right across from where we board there is a fast food place selling fries and deep fried chicken (My mouth waters as I think of the succulence just imagine tearing into that juicy piece of chicken and washing it down with fries&hellip;.DAMN!!!). Their ventilation shaft juts out and points straight in the pedestrians&rsquo; direction. A subtle reminder that you really need to step in and get yourself some fries and chicken. Touche guys touche killing two birds with one stone creating a cool environment inside the establishment and making a bold statement to passers-by on the street&hellip;&rdquo;Smell that&hellip;.I want you to smell that&hellip;.Do you really smell that&hellip;.We have fries inside&hellip;..They smell good don&rsquo;t they. Come in; you know you want to. Do not deny yourself this pleasure.&rdquo; So every time I go to board a matatu is another episode of fighting temptation, fries and chicken edition.</p><p><br />So this humble fellow decides that the hunger is too great to hold back and decides to dig in. With no open windows the scent of hot fries fills the matatu, it gets much much worse when they bought a combo with chicken. Looking around you can visibly see everyone shifting uncomfortably in their seat. Though I once made the mistake of thinking that someone was really uncomfortable &nbsp;in their seat but they were only turning to get their own fries&hellip;.You damn bastard I thought we were brothers in arms. You know it&rsquo;s bad when you see everyone collectively swallow a gulp of saliva and look away and think I will survive this. At that point it becomes a check point marathon whereby you have set check points that tell you you&rsquo;re getting closer to home. It happens often so you will do this unconsciously. Once you get to your stage you make sure to look straight at the culprit and proclaim &ldquo;The devil won&rsquo;t have my soul tonight.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;</p>','gitudaniel@gmail.com','',NULL,NULL,'2016-04-21 22:21:21','2016-05-16 16:32:30',2,NULL,NULL),(6,'Ousting the crowd','Untitled is I','<p>Have you ever walked down a street in the city and noticed how busy it usually is. On the ground it feels like there are hundreds of people all around you. Though if you ever got a bird&rsquo;s eye view you&rsquo;d see that the picture changes. There are not that many people walking on the street it&rsquo;s just that they are all walking in the same general region especially during lunch hours when everyone is fighting to walk in the shade. It&rsquo;s a battle of wits seeing who gets to stay in the shade. Sort of like a stare down contest. You lock eyes with someone and in your head you&rsquo;re going &ldquo;Move, move God damn it move! I&rsquo;m not getting burned but I am willing to offer you up as a sacrifice because clearly one of us has to get burned.&rdquo; If your stare is piercing enough you might notice them move ever so slightly and in that moment you know you&rsquo;ve won. But every once in a while you do meet those devil may care guys who either decide that they are willing to bump into you or think that the universe should bend to their whims. If it is the former you square up and brace for impact if you have the body for that kind of thing. Otherwise respectfully move out of the way. You may curtsy or bow to your master but it&rsquo;s not widely recognized street etiquette so move aside and pretend not to know what just happened.</p><p><br />Ever so rarely there are those who think they own the streets they walk on and decide they are going nowhere fast. It&rsquo;s really a downer for those of us who actually don&rsquo;t know how to saunter casually. Yep I don&rsquo;t know how it is done. I&rsquo;ve tried and failed miserably because I always end up walking too fast, well faster than almost everyone around me. I&rsquo;ve had similar failures when it comes to handwriting it&rsquo;s always too tiny but very neat. Before C.A.Ts my friends would always hold interventions to get me to write in a manner they are most likely to copy. It would always start out well but somewhere in the middle everything would go to shit. With time they gave up and resorted to improving their eyesight. But I digress.</p><p><br />Here you are having a million places to go to, people to see, things to do and this creature of God decides to marvel at the pavements at this particular point in time, in the searing sun I might add. You try to pass them but the street is filled with these kinds of people who seemingly have nowhere to go or are so well organized that they gave themselves enough time to saunter in between tasks. I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m disorganized I just try to get as much done as fast as I can. As I&rsquo;m strategizing on the politest way to pass these guys I sometimes think to myself &ldquo;So this is what they mean when they say the road to success is filled with obstacles.&rdquo; I then proceed to think up all fictional shows and movies I&rsquo;ve watched that could come to my aid. Being the flash doesn&rsquo;t help me. I would still have to maneuver through the throngs of people. Time travel is very effective but I&rsquo;d have to use it often pausing and unpausing time so that people can generally see you come and go. Explaining how you miraculously appear doesn&rsquo;t work so well in real life. As much as I love batman pulling a batman on people is creepy as hell. Flying works but the designers did not envision men and women flying. And I thought designers were supposed to be imaginative and open minded. My most effective solution has been inspired by dragon ball Z. Kamehameha the shit out of pedestrians. (The Kamehameha is a blast of pure energy.) That should solve the problem for the foreseeable future. You see once they&rsquo;ve been dispersed the first time tales of your power will spread like wildfire and everyone will generally stay out of your way. If I get it right I might get to walk whole streets on my own. Then I&rsquo;ll literally own the streets.</p><p>All this is assuming that there are no others who have achieved this ability and feel the need to challenge me as I see in anime.

If I am among the first to enter I have the luxury of choice and I make a quick calculation as to where the sun&rsquo;s greatest impact will be felt throughout the journey and make sure to sit in the opposite aisle. I&rsquo;ll be the guy in the car raising an arm awkwardly. This is a representation of the sun&rsquo;s position as felt by my face. Sometimes I do miscalculate and I burn for my mistakes but more often than not I do get it right. It may sound that I am adding too much complexity to a simple task like boarding a matatu or a bus but unless you suffer from sweaty pig syndrome please keep your opinions to yourself.</p><p><br />As with all journeys they must come to an end eventually and then there&rsquo;s the added task of negotiating with your neighbor to grant you safe passage. For all those who have the courtesy to stand up and give way bless your soul you make the task all the more easier. Then there are the assholes who just think it over and decide to swing their feet in the opposite direction and grant you leeway to maneuver your way out. Personally the only fashion accessory I possess is a satchel that has seen one too many days in the sun and has the fade to prove it. It never leaves my person and goes where I go. There have been demands for a change but those generally die down once I tell them to feel free to buy a replacement.</p><p><br />So this creature of God&nbsp;expects me to maneuver myself and my bag without my bag hitting their face or having a face to ass with my ass all from the comfort of their seat. At such points I curse morality and ethical standards because if I had my way I&rsquo;d fart in their face, face them and do a John Cena face palm move and go my way. In my estimation I guarantee everyone will stand given the ultimatum, &ldquo;Stand or I will fart in your face.&rdquo; But I care too much. Well I wouldn&rsquo;t say I care too much because I do make sure to wiggle my ass in their face discreetly of course under the guise of being stuck. HA! Take that fiend&hellip;</p><p>P.S.<br />I have thought of doing this severally. The farting that is. To a point that my body always has a fart on stand-by for when I do eventually get the guts.

I mean be honest if this what we&rsquo;re living would be it what would be the point of trying to achieve great feats.

This is a question I have been asking myself for a long time now. Are some forms of pain worse than others? Is there a limit to the amount of pain one can endure? Or is endurance of pain subject to adjustment by ones will power?</p><p>I&#39;ve had first hand experience with pain, loss and grief maybe worse than others maybe less than some. All I know is that for that period of my life I was alone and abandoned. All forms of support were yanked away from me and I was left navigating in the dark without a guiding light to guide me.</p><p>I spent a year in the dark wishing that I wouldn&#39;t wake up the next day. I&#39;d go to sleep praying for death. I didn&#39;t have the guts to do it myself. I wanted it to come from somewhere outside of me. The religion that had been forced upon me told me that those who committed suicide went to hell and burned for eternity. At that point to be quite honest I didn&#39;t care. All I knew was that I didn&#39;t have the guts to do it myself. How could I do that to family and friends leave them thinking that they didn&#39;t do enough for me, that they could have done more. When I went I wanted to know that I&#39;d be forgotten. That life would go on as if I never existed.</p><p>How does one go about not existing. I looked upon the frames in our family home the smiling faces and counted all the ones I was in. Maybe if I cut myself out of them I&#39;d be forgetten more easily. I took them down when no one was watching and analyzed the best way to cut myself out and make it seem that nothing was missing from the frame. For that whole year I never took photos why leave people with memories when you&#39;d rather be forgotten. I made my life such that I was easily forgotten. I was the accessory in the room. People speaking over and around me; never directly. This made me happy, knowing that they don&#39;t notice me. I&#39;d be gone for hours and no one would notice. They&#39;d always think that I was somewhere I wasn&#39;t.</p><p>I&#39;d achieved my mission. No one would notice my abscence. I&#39;d never be missed. I&#39;d just be a faint memory no one could place a finger on. I was never a feature in their lives. Just an accessory. I was forgettable, expendable, replaceable and I liked it that way. Now all I had to do was die. When I died I wanted it to be quick and painless. Preferrably in my sleep. I imagined the door being broken down when they eventually realized my absence. Maybe they&#39;d think I went out. I always made sure to remove my key from the door. Make it easier to use the spare key. I imagined the cries of my mother. My father holding it in trying desperately to be strong and the priest saying that it was my time. That God had called him to be with him. The eulogies that would be written of me. Would there be any? Yes there would. They always speak well of the departed. Would I attend my own funeral in spirit and watch as they lowered the casket into the ground and covered it with soil. <em><strong>Ashes to Ashes Dust to Dust</strong></em>. Would I cry as I looked upon this?</p><p>All that was left was to wait for death to come for me. I waited and waited but he never came. Even death wouldn&#39;t take me. Nowadays I spend my days making sure no one sees this side of me. I put up elaborate masks and facades. I&#39;d have made a decent actor I sometimes think. But I make sure not to leave a mark on the earth. That when I go I will not be missed. Death may not have come for me but I have not given up on death.

Bare with me through the ill constructed sentences and poorly punctuated paragraphs. I swear I have a point. Somewhere in here. This is especially for my fellow warriors fighting frontline and centre in this war.</p>\r\n</header>\r\n\r\n<p>Basically, being in my 20s has been a burst so far. I mean, I was ready for the first puberty when the acne happened and these lumps of fat showed up on my chest but honestly I thought that was it. In my mind, when I turned 20, I would magically become this super human adult. The type of adult that didn&rsquo;t need naps in the middle of the day or has to Google the disciples because 12 names are somehow too much information for my shrinking brain. Oh boy! Was I in for a surprise. Just the other day I was watching a YouTube video on the second puberty so I decided to give my input on the same. The nightmare of being a 20 something year old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s begin,shall we?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was a teenager, I was fit as fuck. If you told me to get you something, I would sprint up and get it within seconds because, hot blood. Flexibones. Light body. Carefree mind. The works. Now, if I want to move from the couch to the table to get the remote, I have to change into my work out gear, adorn my body in sweat bands, warm up for ten minutes then still decide that it&rsquo;s too far. Everytime I move from one place to another it feels like I am raising money for blind children in Haiti. Am I the only one who has looked for a pillow to help bring the remote closer? Or called her younger sister from the other room to come pick up something that fell from your hands? I am always like, &ldquo;who is this old hag and where did my youthful energy ran off to?&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s not forget the random body aches that pop up for the oddest of reasons..&nbsp; For example, if I sleep too long, I wake up with a neck ache. If I don&rsquo;t sleep enough, I wake up with a head ache. If I stand up too long, my back aches. If I sit too long, my back aches. If exercise, I wake up with aches even on my hair. If I don&rsquo;t exercise, I wake up tired even on my nails. How old am I again and why the hell is my body crumbling?! I feel like it took me years to learn what is good for my body, what it requires at specific times only to turn 22 and my body is like &ldquo;ha-ha!&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t like that anymore!&rdquo;&nbsp; Especially my skin. I could wake up today and be allergic to the soap I have been bathing with for 22 years just because my skin felt like having an ADD episode. Or the times when my hair falls off if I use certain products that I have used since I was a teenager. It&rsquo;s frustrating coz you never know what crazy allergy you might develop next! These days I could get a pimple just from breathing. Am I allergic to air now? I mean,I have genuinely come to believe that the only way to have flawless skin is to live in a giant test tube. When I flex my wrist,it cracks. My knee cracks. My eyelashes cracks for heaven&rsquo;s sake. Every part of my body just makes painful noises when stretched. Don&rsquo;t even get me started on how, if I eat one fried meal,my body just displays it on my tummy or thigh or boob as a souvenir to show the world what I do when no one is watching! Dear body, please stop being a (insert C word)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can we talk about the emotions real quick? There are days I will wake up motivated enough to run 10 miles as I sign business deals as I teach Sunday School as I am on phone with my boyfriend&hellip; Kill it at everything.&nbsp; Then, there are days I will wake up feeling like I got run over by a truck full of obese women. One day I will be certain that I know exactly who I am and what I want to be then I open my Instagram timeline and change that resolution three hundred and sixty five times. You know those extra beautiful women who have amazing jobs and announce their engagements in perfectly good grammar? You either have a six pack body or a six figure salary. Please. Yeah you girls are not good for my selfesteem. My mind will tell me one very motivating thing then my heart will glide in dressed in all black and steer me in the complete opposite direction. Especially on love. Love is the worst in your 20s. I have fallen in and out of love more in the past 3 years than Taylor Swift has in all her albums. Relationships at this age can confuse the shit out of you! Everyone you meet is the one and every heartbreak feels like the end of the world. Except for those who find you on your asshole i-don&rsquo;t-need-love phase.Those have a different story to tell. Some days I just get really..&nbsp; Ummm.. Can I say horny? Yeah. But if a guy makes a sexual pass at me, I go all Karate Kid-come-Naruto on his ass calling him thirsty! Haha. I have no idea what I want, how I want it and who I want it from. My life is a fucking indie song and there&rsquo;s squat I can do to change that. No matter how many books and blogs I read. Advice kamkunjis I have with my girls. Pep talks I give myself before I go to bed. My heart and mind will do whatever the shit they want then both end up like &lsquo;it wasn&rsquo;t me.&rsquo; Ever liked those who don&rsquo;t like you back and totally ignore those who adore you?? You don&rsquo;t even make sense to yourself. Imagine watching a French movie,with Chinese subtitles. Only you are your own actors and audience. One day I want to get married and have 60 babies but if someone brings the topic of forever, I run out of that place faster than an athlete on steroids. &ldquo;He is so clingy&rdquo; &ldquo;She is moving too fast.&rdquo; we say.. Two days later.. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I just find someone who wants to settle&rdquo;..&nbsp; We want to eat our cake and have it and sell it and share it with our friends and remake it all at once then ask ourselves why we were having cake and not a cookie. Haha. When I was a teenager, I used to cry over petty drama.&nbsp; Now I just cry ALL THE DAMN TIME. ABOUT EVERY DAMN THING. I don&rsquo;t even bother to hide in the bathroom like I used to. If it comes as I am waiting for someone at archives..&nbsp; I just launch myself into a crying frenzy till I find the nearest fried chicken outlet. Yeah. No shame in my game. Emotions just overwhelm you sometimes at this level and those who ignore them are in the bar from Monday to Monday, Tusker Lite&rsquo;ing their cares away. Yo, it&rsquo;s rough out here for a former teenager.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I know I will be a great person in life. At least I like to believe that but there&rsquo;s something about your friend buying their first car or house or landing that coveted deal or getting engaged that sends you into serious panic mode. It makes you doubt everything you have ever worked for in your entire life. The pressure at this age is immense! Everyone looks like they are doing better than you and sometimes you convince yourself you will die poor alone or get eaten by a lion on Mombasa Road. (as this has become a very real way to die of late) I think I have at least two business ideas a day. Everyday. On good days some of us even have 5 because we are so scared of running out of time before we get where we want to go. The mind of a 20 something year old is so scrambled. Sometimes, very apparent things take a lot of extra effort and motivation. Very obvious wisdom can be really easy to dish out and tweet about but extremely hard to implement in your own life. And everyone else who is not feeling this pressure is either waiting on daddy to pass away or drunk 100 hours a week. It&rsquo;s exhausting!&nbsp; Lol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In conclusion? I have no fucking idea! Haha. I try to enjoy the days where my heart, mind and body are aligning to get valuable work done. It may be 10 minutes,enough only to write a meaningful blog post or a whole day, enough to exercise, do assignments on time, be there for a friend/boyfriend and deliver to a client. As rare as they are, those SuperKanyiva (yeah that&rsquo;s a real word, look it up) days are wonderful. I feel unbwogable! Either way, I try to train myself and it gets easier to control with time. The days I break down, I allow myself 5 minutes (more like 5hours) to get to the bottom and weep like a little baby the figure out what I am feeling. After that, I watch reruns of FRIENDS and eat as much chicken as I can. (While praying that my body doesn&rsquo;t notice) I use the pressures from social media to motivate me most of the time and if it&rsquo;s too much, I ignore it all together. We can&rsquo;t all make it at the same time, in the same way. In short, it&rsquo;s a serious work in progress. We aren&rsquo;t the first to experience this post-puberty problems and we won&rsquo;t be the last. It will be over soon. Some have 8 years to go, some have 2, others haven&rsquo;t even began but in the end, all of us have to go through it. It&rsquo;s part of life.. Till we get to the sane stuff,just ride the tide my fellow warriors!</p>\r\n','adys.kanyiva@facebook.com',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2016-05-16 12:59:09','2016-05-16 12:59:09',21,NULL,NULL),(27,'Malique.','Deansweetness','<div>CHAPTER ONE.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>The last thing I remembered was that I was struck by an arrow that had pierced me at the heart. The rescue attempts that my fellow warriors tried on me failed, and just as well, once it stopped, I silently slipped into the underworld, forever cut off from the world of the living.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>I never knew that I would miss the sound of a heart-beat as much as I would miss the very simple task of breathing! My body had not even become cold than I found out that I had to fight for my very afterlife! The very instance I arrived, I was beset by several ghost warriors who were baying for my blood since I had not yet realised that my death had brought an imbalance and a sudden fear that had caused such a ripple in both the underworld and the world above!</div>\r\n\r\n<div>I had to defend myself, and I had to do it quickly. I was on a mission to discover why my presence was the talk of the day. First of all, I had to gather weapons that I would need to fight off my invaders. The only problem was that I was not buried with any, (customarily, in my community, any warrior killed in action was to be buried with their weapons as a sign of respect and honour. In my case, I was not given that honour and the respect, so I wondered.), so I had to fight in order to obtain them. Secondly, you would think it would be easier to fight off very blood-thirsty spirits, you would be wrong! Interestingly, they can be held back for some time, or at least long enough to get their weaponry and amour in my case. The problem, however, would be when they awake again and find out that their favoured objects are gone! Just as well, if you&rsquo;ve risked it, get a very good hiding place before you are caught!</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Apparently, this was to be my life for one whole millennia, defending myself, fending for my very survival and constantly hiding from all my attackers. I made many allies who were supporting me and protecting me, and eventually, the whole underworld was split into two groups, those for me and those against me. What was to become of me? I was to eventually find out my ultimate destination and make a very powerful and greatest friend a ghost would ever want.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>It all started during one of my hiding escapades. I happened to cross into the surface world and had found myself within the cemetery, where I met Skye Larke. He was visiting his friend&rsquo;s grave and had just finished laying the wreath of lilies that he had carried, when he looked up and caught me leaning behind a tree.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Umm&hellip; can I help you sir? Is there anything you need? You look tired.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>I looked around to see who he was addressing, but realised that we were the only ones in the area.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Are you addressing me?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Yes. Who else could I be possibly talking to?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;You can see me? You can really see me?&rdquo; I doubted him, and so looked at myself to clarify that I was indeed a ghost.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Am I not supposed to see you?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Confused, I began walking around the place. His eyes were still trailing me, and this got me more confused and angry. I quickly rushed up to him, tackled him and dropped him onto the ground. I quickly removed my dagger and placed it on his neck.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Who are you working for? Tell me! Zurk sent you to harm me you witch! Tell me your name, stranger or I&rsquo;ll kill you right now!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;No one&hellip; please! Don&rsquo;t hurt me! I don&rsquo;t even know what you are talking about! My name is Skye&hellip;please don&rsquo;t hurt me! I&rsquo;m not a witch!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>I could see the fear in his eyes and I released him, but only barely. You can never be too careful.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Then swear upon Arytha! Swear upon my motherland! Swear that I may not harm you!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Okay, okay! I swear&hellip; just let me go!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>I quickly stood him up and slammed him against the tree. Looking directly in his eyes, I could see that he was completely honest, and finally this convinced me to let him go. He immediately pushed himself away from the tree and took off. I only looked at him once and turned away since I had heard the sound of my attackers. I too took off back into the underworld and hid. This was our first encounter, and I never regretted it.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>In the next several weeks, we occasionally would meet at the cemetery. I was still unsure about him and his supposed &lsquo;gift&rsquo; of communicating with spirits, but I gradually accustomed to his presence. I found out that whenever I crossed into the surface world, I would only materialise before him and no one else. I then realised how stupid Skye would look if we were talking, and worse, I had already remembered that Skye had no idea who I was, thus I decided to reveal to him who I really was.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;You have always been here when I come back into this realm, why?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;I can see that you are tormented and are hurt, aren&rsquo;t you? That is what attracted me to you because I can see it reflecting in your eyes. I only see you when I&rsquo;m here, but each time we meet, and I just turn my back for a second, then you are not there, as though you just disappear! Are you a ghost or am I only dreaming?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the point here! Why are you here? Other than laying flowers on your friend&rsquo;s grave, you always seem to be more concerned about everything I do while I&rsquo;m here! My business is my own, and you have no right to question what torments me or not!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not questioning what you do while you are here, but I only wanted to help you...&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;What help can you, a mere mortal, give me? Do you even know what assails me? Do you know what disturbs me? Do you know how long I have travelled and fought to survive? Do you?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;No&hellip;but&hellip;&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Exactly! You don&rsquo;t! You claim to be able to see me by use of some silly charms, and now you claim to want to help me? Such blasphemy!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;No, but listen&hellip;&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;No! You just shut your mouth or you will be be-headed right where you stand!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>I quickly unsheathed my sword and held it, trembling with anger. I looked at Skye and saw his fear returning, and as he stood a few paces away from me, his hands quickly reached for his throat as he swallowed bitter spittle. I couldn&rsquo;t blame him, and he only wanted to help me, but I was too angry to even care. I turned away from him, still clenching my sword tighter, before I let it drop onto the ground. I rubbed my temples as I tried to calm down before leaning against the tree. I sighed deeply, before looking at him again.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m very sorry for my outburst. I&rsquo;ve been very exhausted about everything, and I don&rsquo;t know what came over me.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok. I&rsquo;m sorry if I have intruded in some very private matter in your life. I only wanted to help you.&rdquo; He sat down on the grass near my sword and admired the stained blade and gilded handle.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Nice sword.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok, and thanks. Tell me, what kind of tomfoolery is it that you use that you can see me? Can&rsquo;t you see that I am only a phantom? A ghost?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;None, and yes I can see that. To tell you the truth, I myself can&rsquo;t understand what is happening. You mentioned charms earlier, but I don&rsquo;t even believe in their power! The first time we met, I was surprised to see you since I remembered that I was the only one in the area, but after you tackled me and made me swear to your motherland, I made up my mind to find out who you really were.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;To find out who I am? Don&rsquo;t you know who I am?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Then, I was not sure, but after what had happened, I went to find out exactly who you were, and it&rsquo;s when it hit me. Your name is Malique, otherwise known as the &lsquo;Unknown Captain&rsquo; or in some other texts &lsquo;The Cursed Warrior&rsquo;.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;&lsquo;In some other texts&rsquo;? What are you talking about? Is this not 1010 AD?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;No, this is the year 2010 AD. It&rsquo;s been exactly one millennia since you died.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Are you serious?! Have I been dead for that long? I never even knew that! It feels like yesterday!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Do you remember what had happened to you?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;I remember that I was struck by an arrow, and then I just saw darkness. The next thing I remember was that I was being chased around the underworld, and with no weapons or amour to protect me!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Without amour or weapons? You were not buried with any? This changes everything! It wasn&rsquo;t wrong that they buried you with nothing?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;It was! The King had the say, I&rsquo;m afraid, but he had no right to do that! I was told what had happened since I never attended my funeral. I was otherwise caught up. Why?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Do you remember anything from your life?

I quickly knelt to pick up my sword. Holding his arm and raising him up, I quickly whispered that he leaves me alone, since I realised that things would go wrong if he stayed. He obliged, and as soon as he left, I was attacked by several bands of soldiers. I had no choice but to push them back into the underworld, helped by several of my allies who came to my rescue. From the corner of my eye I noticed that while Skye was fleeing from the scene, he had turned back, and for only a brief moment, had seen the horrifying forces that had allied themselves with Zurk and the strength that they had attacked me with. He passed out then, but lucky for him by that time I had pushed the warriors away back into the underworld.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>After what had happened, I returned back to the surface world where I bumped onto my closest and best friend and ally I could never give up, Bruchus.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;What are you doing here?

Are you out of your mind? Do you even know what kind of danger you have put the mortal world into? Now you have made it worse by being affiliated with one of them!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>We both turned back into the underworld as we continued to discuss and talk amongst us.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;No! Listen, it was not me who had approached him but he did to me! He&rsquo;s the one who approached me!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;He approached you? What are you talking about? He can see you?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Yes!! He can see me and he knows about me! He even knows my name!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Malique, what have you done? What is his name? We need to get rid of him!&rdquo; He pushed me slightly away from his path, but I quickly grabbed his arm and pulled him back to where I was.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;No, Bruchus! Don&rsquo;t touch him or you will have to answer to me, do you hear? He himself offered to help me, and he may be my only hope of finally helping me to get the rest that I deserve!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Yes, but&hellip;&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;I know what I have done, but I chose to accept his help at whatever cost! The least you can do is to help me defend and protect him, especially if Zurk finds out that I have acquired help from one of the living.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>I looked at Bruchus to see his reaction, and he just sighed. I let go of his arm and watched him as he contemplated on my words.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Ok. I made a vow to be with you for eternity and to defend you at all costs, so be it. I may never understand what you just did. Probably it may free you from this curse, I don&rsquo;t know, but I trust you as a friend and a battle companion.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Thank you my friend!

We may need them to guard him for now as we plan ahead.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll lead the distraction against Zurk&rsquo;s forces. It&rsquo;s too dangerous for you. You need to go with the warriors and warn him yourself so that you can station them at your command. If I find out that you will be followed, I&rsquo;ll send a messenger to warn you.

Let&rsquo;s do this!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>As planned, we divided the troops and began the attack. Bruchus went with over 100,000 of them while I went with only 100 troops back to the surface to look for Skye. When we finally found him, he was locked in his room, afraid of what he had seen at the cemetery.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Are you ok?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Yes&hellip;I think so. What&hellip;what had happened?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you later, but right now, I want you to listen to me. I have here with me 100 troops whom I&rsquo;ve ordered to protect you if in case Zurk finds out that you are helping me. I realised that I had already put you in danger when they found me at the cemetery, a place that was safer for me since it was in the physical world. I only hope that you were not spotted, or else things would go horribly wrong. Zurk will stop at nothing to destroy you if he ever catches you, and he will do it ruthlessly. Remember the cemetery, and you know the rest.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Yes, I saw. So, what would you like me to do?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;I need you to remain underground, anonymous, so that you are not caught by his troops. Stay away from the cemetery grounds at all costs and don&rsquo;t come looking for me at all. Gather all you can that can be useful to me, but keep it to yourself. I&rsquo;ll be coming to you whenever I can, but I repeat, do not come looking for me! Live your life as you would normally do so that you do not arouse suspicion. If we are lucky, we can hide you until we win this war. Do you understand?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Yes, I do. You said &lsquo;we&rsquo;. Do you have someone else helping you?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Yes, my allies in the underworld, but let&rsquo;s not dwell on that right now. I need to go, but I&rsquo;ll leave these guys to protect you and defend you in everything that you will do. You will not see them like you do me, but be confident that you are safe.

We were lucky, but you seem worried. What is disturbing you?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Nothing that will involve me, but I&rsquo;m worried about you.

Do you know that I still don&rsquo;t know why I am being tormented like this? Why I am the fugitive that I have become? Who placed the curse on me that even in death I cannot escape it? What had I done in life that still haunts me even at this very moment? Had I angered the gods that they punish me so? Bruchus, these are the very questions I still ask myself, even as I seek closure! I am so tired, tormented and completely fed up with everything that is going on here!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;I stood up and turned my head away from Bruchus, since I had already began crying.

I don&rsquo;t know that rest, and I fear that I may never know it! It&rsquo;s a really scary experience, but what choice do I have? To top it all off, I don&rsquo;t even know who ordered my death! I was told that it was the king of my country that had ordered it, but who caused him to do that? Did you know that I was not to be introduced into the field until two more summers had passed to finish my training? Not only that, I found out that I was to be put in the front line of the battle, directly in the line of the archers! As a junior officer, I was not allowed to question my superior&rsquo;s motive, so what could I have done?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Bruchus quickly spun me around.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Wait, you were taken to the battlefront even before your training was complete?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;What? That&rsquo;s unheard off!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Also, do you know that I was buried without any weapons and amour? I had to fight in order to obtain the ones that I now have!

Who knows, maybe this stalling can help us even more. I heard that Zurk had sent some spies to check up on our activities, and I wouldn&rsquo;t want to lead them to Skye at all costs. I warned him and told him that our meetings would be less frequent, so he understands. I just told him to write down everything that he would have found out so that he can just hand them over to me so that I can go through them then destroy them. It&rsquo;s risky, but worthwhile.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Then has he given you anything lately?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;No. I haven&rsquo;t got the chance to leave here yet, but I&rsquo;m looking for one.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Well then, it may take a little longer than you were expecting, but keep your eyes and ears peeled for that opportunity. Rumour is that Zurk is expected to attack anytime from now, so you planned well. At least if he was to attack now, we have more than enough troops to defend and protect you.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Thank you my friend.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir, but a letter has just arrived for you.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;A letter? From who? Hmm&hellip;hand it over to Bruchus to read it for me. Maybe we can find out where it&rsquo;s from. Thanks.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in Skye&rsquo;s handwriting. He needs you urgently. He says that there is something wrong going on, and he doesn&rsquo;t know what to do. The guards, he says, had some of their forces attacked! What is going on?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;No! It can&rsquo;t be! That&rsquo;s impossible! How did Zurk find out that Skye was helping me? I need to go back and protect him!&rdquo;&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;No! Remember the spies?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care! I promised him I would come to his rescue if anything were to happen, and I&rsquo;m bound to it! Bruchus, I have no time to continue talking to you because I need to go, but please, cover me. Create a distraction if you must, but all the same, cover me!&rdquo;</div>\r\n','makenadk@yahoo.com',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2016-05-18 13:04:27','2016-05-18 13:04:27',22,NULL,NULL),(33,'Malique.','Deansweetness','<div>&ldquo;Then go. I&rsquo;ll help you, but you owe me one buddy.&rdquo; Turning to the warrior that was in the room, &ldquo;Captain, get your forces and launch a small-scale attack, but do not engage the enemy.

Go!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Yes sir!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>We maneuvered through the underworld avoiding Zurk&rsquo;s forces, till we arrived in the surface world where we parted ways. Making my way with some of the forces, we hurried to Skye&rsquo;s apartment to rescue him. When we arrived, I was shocked to see Skye sitting at his table calmly having some dinner. Our arrival startled him into felling his dinner-table with everything in it.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;What&hellip;what is going on here?!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Skye! We came to help you! Where are they?&rdquo;&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Who? What are you talking about? Are you ok?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;I got your message saying that you were being attacked!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;A message? I haven&rsquo;t sent you a message since our last encounter! You ordered me not to communicate to you at any cost, and it would be your appearance that would determine it! Why? What had happened?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;You never sent me a message? Are you serious? It was in your hand!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Well if you didn&rsquo;t, then who did? I don&rsquo;t understand it!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>I turned towards the direction of the sound, and acknowledged the junior officer that was before me.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Bruchus sent me ahead to give you a message.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;He just found out that the message that you had received was a decoy. He scanned the other messages that you had earlier, and found out that it was a fake! You&rsquo;ve been tricked! Zurk is&hellip;&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Right here!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>We turned to see the enemy, and for the first time, Skye saw who I was up against, and then collapsed due to fear. Zurk just looked and laughed.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;The first time I heard that you were receiving additional help, I thought, it&rsquo;s common. The whole underworld is split between your forces and mine, so what? When I heard that it was no ordinary help, I wondered, what other help can you receive? When I heard that it was a mortal helping you, I thought, ridiculous! How could you probably get such help? How can the human even see you, let alone talk with you? I thought it was a lie, and so I decided to do my own research to discover whether it was true or not. Putting my forces at bay, I spied on you secretly and to my delight, I found out that you were receiving help from a human! The message to you that supposedly was from your friend was the greatest trick that I ever came up with! Surely your honour to keep your promises amuses me, Malique, and it will be your own undoing!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;What are you doing here then? Surely you cannot stand up to me, because you are out-numbered and out-matched!&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m well aware that I cannot attack you since clearly I only came with two of my guards as you can see, but like I said, I just wanted to find out if the rumours were true. Now, let me ask, what kind of help do you expect him to give you?&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;You have no business here Zurk, none at all.&rdquo;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&ldquo;Well, since you&rsquo;ve involved him, it becomes my business as well! Do you think that I shall allow you to continue meeting with him to plan&hellip; whatever it is that you are planning? You are warned Malique! Be sure that he shall never live to speak to you again! Thanks to you, you&rsquo;ve given me a new purpose. Not only do I have to chase you, I also have to chase your friend here!

It wasn&#39;t often that he had no idea what was going on and, oddly enough, he was finding that he sort of liked it. It was a strange reaction but he had always been a little strange and he knew it. When he&rsquo;d found a large envelope in his room with enough secrets and dirt to bury his reputation forever, he&rsquo;d been curious, not afraid. When he had seen the accompanying note asking him to visit a restaurant he&rsquo;d never even heard of on such and such a date, he&rsquo;d even cracked a smile. The part he&rsquo;d liked best was where it said he&#39;d have to find a waiter called Marcus and ask him whether they served Red Mercury. Just for that, he would have gone without the blackmail. Curiosity and risk taking had always been his greatest vices. And so there he was.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marcus had led him somewhere behind the restaurant&rsquo;s kitchens into a small but surprisingly posh conference room. He had been the first but it hadn&#39;t taken very long for a woman who was perhaps 50- maybe 60 years old, to arrive. She had seemed amused to see him for whatever reason and, in his eyes, she exuded a sense of extreme self importance. Her clothing was official and looked expensive though tastefully so. Perhaps she was some big shot business woman, or a banker, or something else like that. She didn&rsquo;t say anything to him and he didn&#39;t fancy making the first move, so he kept silent. She took a seat and now there were three empty chairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next person to arrive was also woman. Kingsley placed her somewhere between 25 and 30. She had dark skin, short hair and the kind of clothes that seemed unfashionable but were also trying to convey that this was done on purpose. A rebel then. A hipster? Whatever the case, he would be extremely surprised if she had anything to do with blackmailing him. She just didn&rsquo;t look the type to do it like this. Eyeing them both with curiosity blended in with hostility, she took a seat. Definitely nothing to do with whatever was going on. She was a victim like him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The newcomer joined the silence though she was clearly not comfortable with it. It looked like she was going to say something when the next person made their way into the room and she turned to look. This time, it was a man. He stopped at the door and Kingsley would not have been surprised if his next action was to take off immediately. His hands were shaking and his thin frame was awkwardly arranged in the pose of a man who wants nothing more than to not be where he is. With conscious effort he walked in, tugged at the hem of his oversized t-shirt as if he was trying to hide something and took a seat. He, predictably, did not say anything and Kingsley did not spare him much thought. He was not the organizer of this little meeting either.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At last, someone walked in to claim the final chair. It was a short, fat, balding man who was, of all things, smiling widely. He looked like the perfect distillation of the old men you&rsquo;d find in a Kenyan bar ordering a cold beer and Nyama choma. Like the kind of man who would leave his house every day in a cowboy hat if his wife did not talk him out of it. Though it was difficult to tell if he was married because his fingers were all covered in rings. His shirt was also unbuttoned enough to allow for a good look at the chains that hung from his neck. He was rich or at least he wanted people to assume that he was. Kingsley clicked in disgust. This was the great conspirator? How... anticlimactic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old man sat down heavily and looked around smiling even more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said a little too loudly, &ldquo;what is it that you all want?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was met with silence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Talk to me,&rdquo; he spoke up again not the least bit ruffled, &ldquo;why have you brought me here?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t him either. Kingsley turned to the woman next to him, the business looking one, and said,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you. You&rsquo;re the one who called us here.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Me?&rdquo; she asked with obviously feigned surprise, &ldquo;why would you think it was me?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;She&#39;s too angry, he&#39;s too scared, he&#39;s too confused and I know it isn&#39;t me. And...would you look at that, we&#39;ve run out suspects.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Maybe whoever called us all just hasn&#39;t arrived yet.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only five chairs here. Whoever put this whole thing together is obviously too obsessed with power games to set it up where they end up without a chair.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Nicely done,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;as is only to be expected of Goat Boy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Goat boy?&rdquo; asked Kingsley taken aback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Goat boy is right,&rdquo; she said leaning back into the chair, &ldquo;I hope you all liked my little invitation cards, I really put a lot of work into making them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What do you want with me?&rdquo; said the younger woman in what was practically a growl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I have a job for you. Settle down, leave the questions for after I&rsquo;m done talking thank you.&rdquo; She paused to let the other woman bite back what she had been going to say</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;First of all we can&rsquo;t have you all be strangers. I was hoping you would all choose to mingle, but since you did not it seems I will have to introduce you. This lovely young lady over here is&hellip;&rdquo; a sly look crept into her eyes, &ldquo;lets call her The Actress. She&rsquo;s extremely talented. Bright future in film for her, mark my words, you&rsquo;ll all know her real name very soon when she blows up. Well... maybe. If she directs more of her talents towards the camera instead of conning foolish tourists out of everything they own.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Actress blanched and Kingsley highly doubted she would be interrupting the rest of the presentation. The woman pointed to the frightened man and he flinched.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We will call this gentleman Tricycle. Don&rsquo;t let his looks fool you, he&#39;s a hardcore criminal. If something can be broken into he can do it. He&#39;s never run into a lock he couldn&#39;t coax into opening. All the right people, perhaps I should say the wrong people depending on how you look at it, know who to call when they really need to retrieve something.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Now, this old bastard,&rdquo; she looked to the latecomer, &ldquo;is Money Bags. He is a disgustingly rich businessman and an expert at getting people to buy into bad investments. Best of all he&rsquo;s got connections in all the right places. See, a long time ago our old friend here realized that if you know when an ambitious young man is about to get his shot before he does, you can tell him. You can imply that it was all your doing, that you&rsquo;ve had his back since day one because you saw his potential. There&rsquo;s a lot of money to be made from cashing in favours like that. Not much work either.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Money Bags practically beamed. It seemed that he had wanted his cleverness acknowledged but had never actually had a forum for it to come up. Being blackmailed wasn&rsquo;t the ideal but Kingsley guessed that sometimes you took what you could get. He knew a little something about not being able to boast about your accomplishments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Finally,&rdquo; she turned to Kingsley, &ldquo;we have Goat Boy. This...this is an interesting one. He&rsquo;s a conman but not of the ordinary sort. He&rsquo;s got money and he&#39;s from a rich family. He&rsquo;s never needed for a single thing in his life. He cons not because he has to but for the sheer thrill of it. Isn&#39;t that right Goat Boy?&nbsp;You do it to see just how far you can take it. And oh do you&nbsp;push that boundary. I don&rsquo;t know if the rest of you heard about this but last year the police in Bungoma arrested a goat because, apparently, the burglar had transformed into the animal to evade capture. They actually put the goat in a jail cell! That was our boy&rsquo;s work. That&rsquo;s the kind of thing he does. It&rsquo;s not about the stealing for him. He did it to see if he could get away with framing a goat for his crime...and he did.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kingsley didn&rsquo;t react. It was true but how in the hell had she known? Maybe he hadn&rsquo;t been quite as smooth as he had thought. Whoever she was, she was very good at digging up hidden information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;As for me,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;you may call me Madame Blackmail. I am the woman who owns you now. I know it, you know it, so let&rsquo;s not play games. I own you and all I need from you is a single job. I need you all to combine your skills and steal something for me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Steal what?&rdquo; Kingsley said his curiosity overpowering his better sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an election coming up&hellip;&rdquo; She started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You want to steal the election?&rdquo; Said Money Bags incredulous, &ldquo;the president one?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No no no. Nothing quite so simple. Boniface Oero is running for president on the GoldenAge ticket. I need him to drop out. I need that seat to be up for grabs within a month and a half at the very latest. I don&rsquo;t know how you will accomplish this and I don&rsquo;t particularly care. But you will do it. Without killing him and without kidnapping him, I need you to steal that candidacy. I don&#39;t think I need to tell any of you what will happen if you don&#39;t.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a stunned silence in the room for the longest time and Kingsley found that he was smiling.</p>\r\n','kevgach@gmail.com',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2016-05-18 14:37:00','2016-05-18 14:37:00',5,NULL,NULL);
